# Introduction to the UNIX Terminal

Much of astronomy research is conducted using UNIX-based operating systems, such as Linux and Mac OS X. Although modern systems include familiar graphical interfaces, all UNIX-based systems also include a command line interface. In Mac OS X, this is provided by the ‘Terminal’ application. The command line interface is based on principles dating back to the 1970s. Although its use may seem arcane, we will see that it can be very powerful, which explains why it still enjoys widespread use in research.

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to the UNIX command line. Using a short set of videos with a total length of about 40 minutes, you will learn how to manipulate files, string together some UNIX tools, and search the contents of files. We’re only scratching the surface here. The set of commands available in an UNIX system is large, most have many options, and the number of ways that different programs can be combined is practically infinite. If you’re getting started with the command line for the first time, it can seem formidable, but we’re here to help!

Drew Newman ([anewman@carnegiescience.edu]), Jason Williams (jewilliams@carnegiescience.edu), and Mahdi Qezlou (mqezlou@carnegiescience.edu) will be holding ‘office hours’ to answer all your UNIX questions and any trouble you may have working through this tutorial. The office hours will be 9:30 am and 2 pm PDT on Tuesday, June 16. You can also email us any time. 

To get started, let’s open a Terminal.

## Opening a Terminal in Mac OS X

There are many ways to open a terminal on a computer running Mac OS X. One way is to use the Finder. Click on the desktop, then on the ‘Go’ menu and locate ‘Utilities’:
